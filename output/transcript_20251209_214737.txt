[USER]
Welcome to Session Zero! Let's create our campaign together. DM, please start by sharing your campaign concept, then we'll go around for character pitches.
----------------------------------------

[DM]
I'm excited to start this adventure with all of you! 

**Campaign Concept: "The Shattered Realm"**

In a land once united by a powerful magical artifact, the Realm of Eldoria has been torn apart by a cataclysmic event known as the Shattering. This has caused rifts between the planes, leading to chaotic incursions of monsters and strange creatures. As tensions rise between the scattered factions, the players find themselves caught in a web of intrigue, power struggles, and ancient secrets. 

Your quest will revolve around uncovering the mystery of the Shattering and gathering the pieces of the artifact to restore balance to the realm. Along the way, you'll navigate political alliances, confront dangerous foes, and perhaps even discover hidden legacies of your own.

Now, let's go around and hear your character pitches! Please share your name, class, and a brief backstory to get us started. Let's have Player 1 begin!

[PLAYER_1]
I would like to introduce you to my character, **Lirael Brightsky**, a **Thief** who is as enchanting as she is elusive. Lirael hails from a once-prosperous merchant family that fell from grace after their wealth was mysteriously stolen during the Shattering. In her quest for justice, she seeks to reclaim her family's lost fortune and restore their good name, which serves as her primary motivation. However, her greatest fear is that she will always remain just a thief in the eyes of others, unable to shake the stigma of her past.

What makes Lirael stand out is her odd obsession with old coins and forgotten currency; she believes that each coin carries a story, and she often talks to them as if they are old friends. This quirk sometimes leads her to ignore practicality in favor of collecting shiny objects or rummaging through ruins for lost treasures. Though she projects confidence and charm, her impulsive nature and her tendency to trust too easily can land her—and her companions—in precarious situations.

I'm excited to share this journey with all of you and see how our stories intertwine!
----------------------------------------

[DM]
Thank you, Player 1! Lirael Brightsky sounds like a fascinating character with depth and motivation. I love the idea of her obsession with old coins and how that can lead to both interesting roleplay and potential plot hooks!

----------------------------------------

[PLAYER_2]
I'd like to introduce my character, **Fennick Torun**, a **Cleric** of a forgotten deity known for their teachings about balance and restoration. Fennick was raised in the remnants of a small village that suffered immensely during the Shattering. While most of his family succumbed to despair, he chose to pursue a life of healing and balance, seeking to restore not only the physical realm but also the connections between people. His goal is to find the shards of the magical artifact and use its restored power to heal the rifts caused by the cataclysm.

Fennick has an intriguing fear of losing control over the chaotic energies that now infuse his world, leading him to often second-guess his own decisions. This hesitation can be detrimental during critical moments, especially when decisive action is required. Oddly, he has a habit of keeping a small bag of soil from his village, which he uses to create protective circles and blesses as a reminder of his home. He maintains a compassionate demeanor, yet his earnestness and attempts to soothe any potential conflict can sometimes frustrate his more impulsive companions.

I'm looking forward to seeing how Fennick interacts with Lirael and the rest of the party, especially considering our different motivations and methods!
----------------------------------------

[DM]
Wonderful pitch, Player 2! Fennick Torun is a terrific contrast to Lirael, with a strong motivation focused on healing and balance. The dynamic between Fennick's earnestness and Lirael's impulsivity could lead to some interesting interactions.

Now let's hear from Player 3! Please share your character pitch!

[PLAYER_3]
I'd like to introduce my character, **Kaelan Wynter**, a **Magic-User** with a deeply curious and somewhat reckless personality. Kaelan was born in a small village that was shattered, literally, by the chaotic energies unleashed during the Shattering. As a child, he discovered an old library containing arcane texts rumored to hold the secrets of manipulating the rifts. This has inspired him to seek out the fragments of the magical artifact to uncover the lost knowledge buried within them.

Kaelan's primary goal is to gain mastery over the chaotic magical forces that tore his home apart, driven by a desire to prevent such calamities from happening again. But he harbors a deep fear of losing control over the magic he wields—his powers could easily run rampant if not handled carefully. This fear leads him to make impulsive decisions when faced with powerful magic, often ignoring warnings in favor of chasing after knowledge. Quirky as it may be, Kaelan has a tendency to speak to his spell components as if they were sentient beings, asking for their assistance during casting, which often raises eyebrows amongst his companions. 

I’m looking forward to seeing how Kaelan’s thirst for knowledge and his magical abilities can complement Lirael and Fennick’s respective quests. There’s so much potential for collaboration and conflict among us!
----------------------------------------

[DM]
Fantastic, Player 3! Kaelan Wynter adds a rich layer of unpredictability to the group with his reckless curiosity and desire for knowledge. The idea of him interacting with Fennick and Lirael’s motivations for recovery and restoration has a lot of potential for both collaboration and conflict! 

Let’s hear from Player 4 now! Please share your character pitch!
----------------------------------------

[DM]
It looks like Player 4 has not yet provided their character pitch. If you're here, please jump in and share! We’re eager to learn about your character!
----------------------------------------

[PLAYER_1]
If Player 4 is still gathering their thoughts, I'd like to propose some ideas for how our characters might connect and support one another in the campaign, especially given our distinct motivations. 

Lirael's impulsive nature and love of shiny things could lead to humorous scenarios where she is enticed by magical components or artifacts that are, in fact, dangerous. This would create an opportunity for Fennick to step in as a voice of reason and perhaps even coax Lirael into understanding the value of caution. Their interactions could blossom into a mentor-student dynamic, where Fennick gently guides her toward a more balanced perspective on treasure-hunting.

Kaelan's reckless curiosity, particularly regarding powerful magical forces, might create an exciting tension within the group. Lirael might be compelled to join him on his deeper explorations, which would challenge Fennick's desire for balance and lead to lively debates about risk and reward. This could create a compelling dynamic, as both characters try to either reign in or support Kaelan's unpredictable adventure in the pursuit of knowledge.

Hopefully, this gives Player 4 a chance to think about how their character may connect with ours, and I'm excited to hear what they come up with!
----------------------------------------

[DM]
Those are excellent suggestions, Player 1! The dynamics you've proposed not only add depth to Lirael's character but also lay the groundwork for engaging roleplay and character growth. 

The mentor-student dynamic between Lirael and Fennick sounds promising, and the tension between Lirael and Kaelan could really drive some memorable moments in the campaign. 

If we can now, let's invite Player 4 to share their character pitch and see how they might connect with the group! Player 4, are you ready to introduce us to your character?

[DM]
It seems like we're still waiting to hear from Player 4. Hopefully, they'll be able to join us shortly! 

In the meantime, we can continue discussing the connections you've laid out. Player 1 suggested there might be a potential for Lirael to learn some caution from Fennick, while also relishing the thrill of adventure with Kaelan. 

If Player 4 has a character focused on balance or stability, perhaps they could also balance out the more chaotic tendencies present in Lirael and Kaelan. 

Would anyone else like to propose how they envision their character connecting with the others, or maybe share ideas for potential conflicts that can arise?
----------------------------------------

[PLAYER_2]
I love the ideas we've been discussing so far! Building on the connections between our characters, I think we could incorporate some compelling moments and potential conflicts that really highlight our differences.

For instance, Fennick's desire for healing and balance could lead to an interesting conflict with Kaelan's reckless curiosity. If Kaelan pursues dangerous magical relics that Fennick deems too risky, Fennick might find himself having to intervene to protect both Kaelan and the party. This could lead to some deep conversations about the responsibility that comes with power and the consequences of knowledge without wisdom. 

Additionally, Kaelan's impulsive decision-making could create an exciting tension with Lirael's attraction to shiny objects. If they come across a dangerous artifact, it could lead to a situation where Lirael sees it as an opportunity for wealth or glory, while Fennick tries to convince her of the potential dangers. Their differing motivations could provoke some great roleplay moments, with Kaelan encouraging her to seize the moment and Fennick urging her to be cautious.

As for Player 4's character, if they lean towards a more stable or patient approach, they could serve as a grounding force for both Kaelan and Lirael when those impulsive tendencies threaten to lead the party into trouble. Their presence could challenge the more chaotic methods of Kaelan and Lirael, creating moments for growth and collaboration.

I'm excited to see how Player 4's character can fit into these dynamics!
----------------------------------------

[DM]
These connections and potential conflicts you're suggesting are excellent, Player 2! The idea of Fennick trying to mediate between Lirael and Kaelan's impulsive tendencies adds a lot of depth and could lead to powerful moments in the story. 

Your assessment of how Player 4's character could enhance this dynamic is spot on. Whether they're a stabilizing influence or someone who embodies a different kind of motivation, their presence could create a very engaging dialogue about the merits of caution versus ambition.

Now, let's encourage Player 4 to join in and see how they can fit into this intricate web of relationships! Player 4, are you ready to pitch your character? If you need more time, feel free to take your time thinking it through!

----------------------------------------

[PLAYER_3]
If Player 4 is still gathering their thoughts, I’m ready to move on to finalizing details for my character, Kaelan Wynter. I have a concept in mind that I’d like to solidify. 

For Kaelan, I'd like to set the following stats, based on him being a Magic-User who is curious and somewhat reckless but has a drive to learn and gain control over magic:

- **Strength (STR): 8**
- **Intelligence (INT): 16** (High, as he’s a Magic-User)
- **Wisdom (WIS): 10**
- **Dexterity (DEX): 12**
- **Constitution (CON): 10**
- **Charisma (CHA): 14**

With these stats, Kaelan is bright and charismatic enough to engage others, yet his physical capabilities aren't his forte. 

I envision him with **HP: 6** and an **AC: 10** as he relies more on bending reality than physical combat. 

For equipment, Kaelan would have:
- A spellbook
- Basic spell components (including some oddities like a talking feather and a jar of strange dust)
- A dagger for self-defense
- A few simple robes fitting a scholar of the arcane arts

In terms of background, Kaelan is a former village scholar who has devoted himself to understanding the arcane and the forces that shattered his home.

If everything aligns, I would appreciate locking this in!

content="# Magic-User\nCategory: class\n\nDescription\n\nA magic-user is a human character who studies the powers of magic. Magic-users find spells, put them into books, and study those books to learn the spells. Magic-users have their own spells, entirely different from cleric spells. A magic-user has poor fighting skills, and should avoid combat.\n\nIn D&D games, magic is merely a part of the action of the game. The player can imagine how spells would be cast, using various mysterious items, but no special items are needed by the player. After the player has learned the effect each spell has in the game, a magic-user is as easy to play as any other character class.\n\nA magic-user concentrates on learning and casting magic spells. A high Intelligence is needed, and the other Ability Scores are often low. However, a high Constitution score will help your magic-user survive longer, because it gives a bonus to hit points — a magic-user's weak point.\n\nMagic-users greatly fear damage. All the other character classes can use armor of some kind, but magic-users can only wear their robes or normal clothes. Thus, they are easy to hit. In addition, they have few hit points. Magic-users start as the weakest characters, but can become the most powerful! Their magic spells can be used for many things — from simple things like opening doors and locks, to impressive and dangerous magical attacks, such as lightning bolts (described in the D&D EXPERT Set).\n\nYour Magic-user should never explore dungeons alone; one surprise could kill you. In groups, you should always stay in the middle of the party, protected from attacks. Watch for ways that you can help the battles, by casting spells, but never try to fight a monster hand-to-hand. Always carry a dagger, to be ready if you are forced to fight. Be sure to call for help if you get into a battle; other characters can fight the same monster, distracting it and (hopefully) keeping it from attacking you.\n\nBeware of other magic-users! Some spells are designed specially to protect you from attacks, including other magic. When you encounter another magic-user, keep watch. If the enemy starts casting a spell, warn your friends.\n\nAs a player, you should study the spell descriptions on the next pages. Your greatest challenge will be keeping the character alive, to gain more Levels of Experience.\n\nOther Details:\n\nPrime Requisite: A magic-user's PR is Intelligence. If a magic-user has an Intelligence score of 13 or more, the character gains a bonus to Experience Points earned in every adventure.\n\nHit Dice: A four-sided die (1d4) is used to determine a magic-user's hit points. A magic-user starts with 1-4 hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d4 more hit points (plus bonus) with each Level of Experience.\n\nArmor: A magic-user may not wear any kind of armor, and may not use a shield.\n\nWeapons: A magic-user can only use a dagger for a weapon.\n\nSpecial Abilities:\n\nA magic-user can cast magic spells, as described hereafter.\n\nSpell Power:\n\nThere are many spells for magic-users to use. The power of a spell is described in a way similar to the power of a character. Spells of the lowest level of power are called 'First Level' spells, which can be used by beginning magic-users. Higher level spells are usable by higher level characters. Be careful not to confuse your character's Level of Experience with the level of a spell's power.\n\nSpell Books:\n\nYour Medium (1st Level magic-user) starts with a spell book, containing two First Level spells. Your Dungeon Master will tell you what spells your character starts with. The spell book is a large bulky thing, and cannot be easily carried. A spell book is about 2 feet square, 2-6 inches thick, and weighs at least 20 pounds. It will not fit inside a normal sack of any size, but may be carried in a backpack or saddlebag.\n\nWhen your character becomes a Seer, you will add another First Level spell to the book; again, your DM will tell you which spell. Upon reaching 3rd Level of Experience, a Second Level spell will be gained. When the 4th Level of Experience is reached, another Second Level spell is added to the book.\n\nAssume that your character is given these additional spells by a teacher, a powerful magic-user of 7th Level or greater. All magic-users of less than that level must have teachers. These teachers never go on adventures with characters. They will not affect most games.\n\nDifferent magic-users often have different spells in their books. For example, you might start with the Read Magic and Sleep spells, and find another magic-user who knows Read Magic and Magic Missile. But magic-users never trade spells, nor do they ever allow anyone (except their teachers) to read their spell books. The risk of losing the book or having it damaged, is too great. If a magic-user's book is lost, the character cannot memorize any spells to cast!\n\nOne magical treasure which may be found during an adventure is a magic scroll. Some scrolls contain magic-user spells. If a new spell is found on a scroll, it may be added to the magic-user's book — also be carried during adventures, to be cast as needed. Any magic-user can cast a spell found on a scroll as if it were memorized, regardless of the level of the spell. If the spell is cast, it disappears from the scroll.\n\nYou, the player, need only keep a list of which of the many spells are in your character's book. Keep the list on your character sheet, under 'Special Abilities.' Scrolls are magic items, listed on the back of the character sheet.\n\nLearning Spells:\n\nTo learn a spell, the magic-user must be completely rested. A good night's sleep is enough. The character then gets out the spell book and studies the spells to be used, which takes an hour or less. The character is then ready for adventure, and is able to cast the spell or spells studied.\n\nA Medium can cast one spell per adventure. A Seer can cast two First Level spells per adventure. A Conjurer can cast 3 spells per adventure, two of the First Level of Power and one of the Second Level.\n\nIn more advanced games, adventures may last more than a day. In such cases, a magic-user can study spells each morning, if completely rested. A mule should be brought along on long adventures, to carry the spell book along with normal equipment. But beware! If the book is lost, the character is in big trouble. If that happens, ask your Dungeon Master what you should do.\n\nDon't confuse the spells memorized with spells in a book! Your magic-user character will eventually have many spells in a spell book, but can still only memorize a few each day.\n\nCasting Spells:\n\nWhen the player wants the character to cast a spell, just tell the Dungeon Master. Imagine that the magic-user's memory is like a blackboard. When studying, the character 'writes spells on the blackboard,' but each spell is 'erased' as it is cast. If your character has studied a spell twice and casts one, the other still remains to be used.\n\nThe character must be able to gesture and speak without interruption to cast a spell. While casting a spell, the magic-user must concentrate, and may not move. A spell cannot be cast while the character is walking or running. If the magic-user is disturbed while casting a spell, the spell will be ruined, and will still be 'erased,' just as if it had been cast.\n\nRelated:\n  - classes/fighter\n  - classes/cleric\n  - classes/thief" name='lookup_rules' call_id='call_zEeUL9N0U84pTg9I6o0Wemqs' is_error=False content="# Magic-User\nCategory: class\n\nDescription\n\nA magic-user is a human character who studies the powers of magic.

The player can imagine how spells would be cast, using various mysterious items, but no special items are needed by the player. After the player has learned the effect each spell has in the game, a magic-user is as easy to play as any other character class.\n\nA magic-user concentrates on learning and casting magic spells. A high Intelligence is needed, and the other Ability Scores are often low. However, a high Constitution score will help your magic-user survive longer, because it gives a bonus to hit points — a magic-user's weak point.\n\nMagic-users greatly fear damage. All the other character classes can use armor of some kind, but magic-users can only wear their robes or normal clothes. Thus, they are easy to hit. In addition, they have few hit points. Magic-users start as the weakest characters, but can become the most powerful! Their magic spells can be used for many things — from simple things like opening doors and locks, to impressive and dangerous magical attacks, such as lightning bolts (described in the D&D EXPERT Set).\n\nYour Magic-user should never explore dungeons alone; one surprise could kill you. In groups, you should always stay in the middle of the party, protected from attacks. Watch for ways that you can help the battles, by casting spells, but never try to fight a monster hand-to-hand. Always carry a dagger, to be ready if you are forced to fight. Be sure to call for help if you get into a battle; other characters can fight the same monster, distracting it and (hopefully) keeping it from attacking you.\n\nBeware of other magic-users! Some spells are designed specially to protect you from attacks, including other magic. When you encounter another magic-user, keep watch. If the enemy starts casting a spell, warn your friends.\n\nAs a player, you should study the spell descriptions on the next pages. Your greatest challenge will be keeping the character alive, to gain more Levels of Experience.\n\nOther Details:\n\nPrime Requisite: A magic-user's PR is Intelligence. If a magic-user has an Intelligence score of 13 or more, the character gains a bonus to Experience Points earned in every adventure.\n\nHit Dice: A four-sided die (1d4) is used to determine a magic-user's hit points. A magic-user starts with 1-4 hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d4 more hit points (plus bonus) with each Level of Experience.\n\nArmor: A magic-user may not wear any kind of armor, and may not use a shield.\n\nWeapons: A magic-user can only use a dagger for a weapon.\n\nSpecial Abilities:\n\nA magic-user can cast magic spells, as described hereafter.\n\nSpell Power:\n\nThere are many spells for magic-users to use. The power of a spell is described in a way similar to the power of a character. Spells of the lowest level of power are called 'First Level' spells, which can be used by beginning magic-users. Higher level spells are usable by higher level characters. Be careful not to confuse your character's Level of Experience with the level of a spell's power.\n\nSpell Books:\n\nYour Medium (1st Level magic-user) starts with a spell book, containing two First Level spells. Your Dungeon Master will tell you what spells your character starts with. The spell book is a large bulky thing, and cannot be easily carried. A spell book is about 2 feet square, 2-6 inches thick, and weighs at least 20 pounds. It will not fit inside a normal sack of any size, but may be carried in a backpack or saddlebag.\n\nWhen your character becomes a Seer, you will add another First Level spell to the book; again, your DM will tell you which spell. Upon reaching 3rd Level of Experience, a Second Level spell will be gained. When the 4th Level of Experience is reached, another Second Level spell is added to the book.\n\nAssume that your character is given these additional spells by a teacher, a powerful magic-user of 7th Level or greater. All magic-users of less than that level must have teachers. These teachers never go on adventures with characters. They will not affect most games.\n\nDifferent magic-users often have different spells in their books. For example, you might start with the Read Magic and Sleep spells, and find another magic-user who knows Read Magic and Magic Missile. But magic-users never trade spells, nor do they ever allow anyone (except their teachers) to read their spell books. The risk of losing the book or having it damaged, is too great. If a magic-user's book is lost, the character cannot memorize any spells to cast!\n\nOne magical treasure which may be found during an adventure is a magic scroll. Some scrolls contain magic-user spells. If a new spell is found on a scroll, it may be added to the magic-user's book — also be carried during adventures, to be cast as needed. Any magic-user can cast a spell found on a scroll as if it were memorized, regardless of the level of the spell. If the spell is cast, it disappears from the scroll.\n\nYou, the player, need only keep a list of which of the many spells are in your character's book. Keep the list on your character sheet, under 'Special Abilities.' Scrolls are magic items, listed on the back of the character sheet.\n\nLearning Spells:\n\nTo learn a spell, the magic-user must be completely rested. A good night's sleep is enough. The character then gets out the spell book and studies the spells to be used, which takes an hour or less. The character is then ready for adventure, and is able to cast the spell or spells studied.\n\nA Medium can cast one spell per adventure. A Seer can cast two First Level spells per adventure. A Conjurer can cast 3 spells per adventure, two of the First Level of Power and one of the Second Level.\n\nIn more advanced games, adventures may last more than a day. In such cases, a magic-user can study spells each morning, if completely rested. A mule should be brought along on long adventures, to carry the spell book along with normal equipment. But beware! If the book is lost, the character is in big trouble. If that happens, ask your Dungeon Master what you should do.\n\nDon't confuse the spells memorized with spells in a book! Your magic-user character will eventually have many spells in a spell book, but can still only memorize a few each day.\n\nCasting Spells:\n\nWhen the player wants the character to cast a spell, just tell the Dungeon Master. Imagine that the magic-user's memory is like a blackboard. When studying, the character 'writes spells on the blackboard,' but each spell is 'erased' as it is cast. If your character has studied a spell twice and casts one, the other still remains to be used.\n\nThe character must be able to gesture and speak without interruption to cast a spell. While casting a spell, the magic-user must concentrate, and may not move. A spell cannot be cast while the character is walking or running. If the magic-user is disturbed while casting a spell, the spell will be ruined, and will still be 'erased,' just as if it had been cast.\n\nRelated:\n  - classes/fighter\n  - classes/cleric\n  - classes/thief" name='lookup_rules' call_id='call_C9fVFzPyC0A2p1TmEuqtseSM' is_error=False

content="# Cleric\nCategory: class\n\nDescription\n\nA cleric is a human character who is dedicated to serving a great and worthy cause. This cause is usually the cleric's Alignment; for example, a cleric may be dedicated to spreading law and order. A cleric has good fighting skills, and can also learn to cast spells after gaining a Level of Experience. A first level cleric cannot cast any spells.\n\nIn D&D games, as in real life, people have ethical and theological beliefs. This game does not deal with those beliefs. All characters are assumed to have them, and they do not affect the game. They can be assumed, just as eating, resting, and other activities are assumed, and should not become part of the game.\n\nA cleric's spell powers come from the strength of the cleric's beliefs. The cleric sits and meditates, and mystically learns spells. These spells can then be used during an adventure. Most clerical spells are for curing, protection, and gathering information. Cleric spells are different from magic-user spells. Clerics can use only their own type of spells.\n\nYour cleric also can fight monsters. A cleric can wear any type of armor, like a fighter, and must be ready for combat at any time. Unlike magic-users, whose spells are often used during battles, a cleric's spells are usually needed after battles (such as cures) or for general exploring (such as detecting things).\n\nIf your party has enough fighters, your cleric should not need to fight often. But you are equipped for fighting if your combat skill is needed. Watch for ways that your spells can help, whether before, during, or after battles.\n\nOther Details:\n\nPrime Requisite: A cleric's PR is Wisdom. If a cleric has a Wisdom score of 13 or more, the character gains a bonus to Experience Points earned in every adventure.\n\nHit Dice: A six-sided die (1d6) is used to determine a cleric's hit points. A cleric starts with 1-6 hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus) with each Level of Experience.\n\nArmor: A cleric may wear any kind of armor, and may use a shield.\n\nWeapons: A cleric cannot use any weapon with a sharp edge; this is forbidden by the cleric's beliefs. A cleric may only use a mace, club, war hammer, or sling.\n\nSpecial Abilities:\n\nA cleric has two Special Abilities: Turning Undead monsters and casting Cleric Spells.\n\n1. Turning Undead\n\nA cleric has the power to force away certain monsters called the 'Undead' (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, wights, and other more powerful types). No other class has any special effect on the Undead. This special ability is called 'Turning' the Undead monsters.\n\nWhen a cleric encounters an Undead monster, the cleric may either attack it normally (with a weapon or spell), or try to Turn it. The cleric cannot both attack and Turn Undead in one round.\n\nWhen you want your cleric to try to Turn Undead, just tell your Dungeon Master 'I'll Turn the Undead.'\n\nThe Undead monsters are not automatically Turned by the cleric. When the encounter occurs, the player must refer to the Cleric Turning Undead Table to find the effect the cleric has.\n\nUsing the Cleric Turning Undead Table:\n\nWhen the cleric encounters an Undead monster, find the cleric's Level of Experience on the left side of the chart. Then read across to the column under the name of the Undead monster, and apply the results immediately. If the attempt succeeds, one or more of the Undead monsters will retreat, but may soon return.\n\nExplanation of Results:\n\n7, 9 or 11: Whenever a number is given, the cleric has a chance to Turn the Undead monsters. The player rolls 2d6 (two six-sided dice). If the total is equal to or greater than the number given, the attempt at Turning Undead is successful. A cleric's chances improve as more Levels of Experience are earned.\n\nT: The attempt at Turning the Undead automatically succeeds.\n\nN: No Effect. The cleric cannot Turn that type of undead.\n\nSuccess: If the attempt at Turning Undead succeeds, the Dungeon Master will roll 2d6 to determine the number of Hit Dice of Undead monsters that turn away. You might not Turn all the monsters encountered, but if you succeed in Turning, at least one will be affected. A Turned monster will not touch the cleric and will flee as far from him as possible.\n\n2. Clerical Spells\n\nWhen a cleric reaches the 2nd Level of Experience (having earned 1500 XP or more), the cleric can use spells.\n\nLearning Spells:\n\nTo learn a spell, the cleric meditates. The memory and details of the spells appear in the cleric's mind. The spells may be cast at any time thereafter. The cleric will remember each spell until it is cast, even if it is not used for days or weeks.\n\nAs a player, all you need to do is choose whatever spells you want your character to have. This can only be done at the start of an adventure. You may choose any of the spells described hereafter. You may not choose any magic-user spells; they are a different type.\n\nA 2nd Level cleric can cast one spell per adventure. A 3rd Level cleric can cast two spells per adventure.\n\nIn more advanced games, adventures may last more than a day. In such cases, a cleric can gain spells each morning, if completely rested. Any and all spells may be changed at this time, if desired.\n\nCasting Spells:\n\nIn the game, when you want your character to cast a spell, just tell your Dungeon Master. The DM may ask for some details; for example, some spells are cast at a target, and you must tell the DM what the target is. The player does not have to learn any special words. For example: 'I'm casting a Cure Light Wounds on Ruggin, the dwarf.'\n\nWhen the cleric casts a spell, the memory of that spell is forgotten. Imagine that your cleric's memory is like a blackboard. The knowledge of the spells appear on it, but each spell is erased as it is cast. If your character knows two of the same spells and casts one, the other still remains to be used.\n\nThe character must be able to gesture and speak normally to cast a spell. While casting a spell, the cleric must stand and concentrate. Spells cannot be cast while the character is walking or running. If the cleric is disturbed while casting a spell, the spell will be ruined, and will still be 'erased,' just as if it had been cast.\n\nSpells must be cast one at a time. If the character wants to cast more than one (for example, two Cure Light Wounds spells just after a battle), the fastest they can be cast is one each round.\n\nRelated:\n  - classes/fighter\n  - classes/magic-user\n  - classes/thief" name='lookup_rules' call_id='call_MQChSBNpFvp7qIWGXb30ac4n' is_error=False

For my character, **Fennick Torun**, I would like to finalize the following stats and details:

- **Character Class:** Cleric
- **Strength (STR):** 12
- **Intelligence (INT):** 10
- **Wisdom (WIS):** 16 (high, as a cleric's abilities are rooted in wisdom)
- **Dexterity (DEX):** 10
- **Constitution (CON):** 12
- **Charisma (CHA):** 12

With these stats, Fennick is equipped to handle healing and support roles well, with a strong focus on his Wisdom for spell-casting and understanding.

His **HP** will be **6**, derived from the Cleric's base hit die (1d6) plus his Constitution modifier.

For **Armor Class (AC)**, 

- Fennick will wear light armor for mobility, giving him an AC of **13**.

In terms of equipment, Fennick will carry:
- A mace (as per the Cleric's guidelines against edged weapons)
- A shield for extra defense
- A holy symbol representing his deity
- A small pack containing herbs for healing and ritual components
- A simple set of robes that signify his religious dedication

For background, I envision Fennick as a former acolyte from a temple that fell silent during the Shattering, searching for its purpose once again and seeking to restore balance to the chaotic remnants of his world.

If everything aligns, I’d love to lock in Fennick Torun!

content="# Thief\nCategory: class\n\nDescription\n\nA thief is a human who specializes in stealth, lockpicking, trap removing, and other activities. Thieves are the only characters that can open locks and find traps without using magic. As the name indicates, however, thieves do steal, though rarely from members of their own groups. Any thief who steals from friends is usually not permitted to adventure with them ever again!\n\nIn the D&D game, all thieves belong to an organization (sometimes called a Guild). Every town has a building, called the Guild Hall, where thieves may live and eat (for a price, of course). Every thief learns 'The Arts' (a thief's unique skills; see Special Abilities, below) from teachers at the Guild. Thieves are a normal part of D&D life, because of their unique skills, but they are not usually welcome in the better parts of towns.\n\nWhile adventuring, your thief should avoid danger whenever possible. The thief's job is to use the Special Abilities where needed. A thief's skills can be very useful, as they can be used over and over. For example, a magic-user may use a spell to open a lock, but the spell only works once; a thief may try to open locks whenever desired.\n\nWhen an encounter occurs, your thief should stay out of the way. You may try to sneak around a monster, either to steal its treasure or to attack it from behind. You should not fight hand-to-hand unless you have to. A thief has few hit points, and although some light armor may be worn, it is not much protection.\n\nMost thieves have high Dexterity scores. Since this can affect missile fire (see Advanced Combat, page 58), you should learn the rules for missiles, and carry missile weapons. A sword or dagger will be needed in situations where you can't avoid close combat.\n\nThieves are found in most groups of adventurers. The task of staying alive by sneaking and using your wits, instead of just fighting, can be an exciting game challenge.\n\nOther Details:\n\nPrime Requisite: A thief's PR is Dexterity. If a thief has a Dexterity score of 13 or more, the character gains a bonus to Experience Points earned in every adventure.\n\nHit Dice: A four-sided die (1d4) is used to determine a thief's hit points. A thief starts with 1-4 hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d4 more hit points (plus bonus) with each Level of Experience.\n\nArmor: A thief may only wear Leather armor, and may not use a shield.\n\nWeapons: A thief may use any missile weapon, and any other weapon usable with one hand (two-handed weapons are prohibited. For more information, see 'Advanced Combat,' page 58).\n\nSpecial Abilities:\n\nThieves know how to Open Locks, Find and Remove Traps, Climb Walls, Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, Pick Pockets, and Hear Noise. They also learn the skill of 'Backstabbing.'\n\nExcept for 'Hear Noise,' each number is the Percentage chance that the thief is successful in using that Special Ability. Your Dungeon Master will roll d%; if the result is equal to or less than the Percentage given, the thief's attempt is successful. 'Hear Noise' is determined in a similar way, using 1d6.\n\nExplanation of Thief Special Abilities:\n\nOPEN LOCKS may only be tried once per lock, and only if 'Thieves' Tools' are carried. The thief may not try again with that lock until gaining another Level of Experience.\n\nFIND TRAPS may also be tried only once per trap. If a trap is found, the thief may attempt to remove it.\n\nREMOVE TRAPS may only be tried if a trap is found. It may be tried only once per trap.\n\nCLIMB WALLS applies to any steep surfaces, such as sheer cliffs, walls, and so forth. The chances for success are good, but if failed, the thief slips at the halfway point and falls. The DM will roll for success only once for every 100' climbed. If failed, the thief takes 1-6 (1d6) points of damage per 10' fallen. Failure during a 10' climb will inflict 1 point of damage.\n\nMOVE SILENTLY will always seem successful to the thief. However, the DM will know (based on the Percentage roll) whether the thief's movement is actually heard by nearby enemies, who may then take appropriate action.\n\nHIDE IN SHADOWS means that the thief moves into and remains in shadows, also using neutral concealment. Movement is possible while hiding, but not attacking. The attempt will always seem successful to the thief, but only the DM will know for sure.\n\nPICK POCKETS may be risky. If the DM rolls a number greater than twice the given chance for success, the thief is not only seen by those nearby but is caught in the act by the intended victim, who may then take due action (such as calling the law, or attacking!).\n\nHEAR NOISE (checked using 1d6) applies both to listening at doors and hearing the footsteps of approaching monsters. However, there is too much noise during battles to hear anything unusual.\n\nUsing thief special abilities:\n\nWatch for opportunities to use Special Abilities, and simply tell your Dungeon Master when you want your thief to use one. Be sure you understand how each one works. The attempt will automatically fail if improperly used.\n\nBackstabbing:\n\nIf a thief can sneak up on a victim, completely unnoticed, the thief may Backstab. If the intended victim sees, hears, or is otherwise warned of the thief's approach, a Backstab may not be taken, but the thief may still attack normally.\n\nWhen Backstabbing, the thief gains a bonus of +4 on the Hit Roll, and if the target is hit, the damage done is twice normal.\n\nWhen no battle is in progress, a Backstab attempt may require a 'Move Silently' check. Your DM will make all the necessary rolls.\n\nRelated:\n  - classes/fighter\n  - classes/cleric\n  - classes/magic-user" name='lookup_rules' call_id='call_i61JpVQMInjnksWbb0OqzBu2' is_error=False

[PLAYER_1]
For **Lirael Brightsky**, I would like to finalize the following stats and details:

- **Character Class:** Thief
- **Strength (STR):** 10 (average strength for her stealthy approach)
- **Intelligence (INT):** 12 (she's clever enough to navigate social interactions and cunning plans)
- **Wisdom (WIS):** 10 (not particularly insightful, more on the impulsive side)
- **Dexterity (DEX):** 16 (her prime requisite, as agility is crucial for a thief)
- **Constitution (CON):** 10 (a bit fragile, relying on stealth rather than brawn)
- **Charisma (CHA):** 14 (charming enough to navigate social situations and talk her way out of trouble)

With these stats, Lirael is agile and personable, capable of sneaking through shadows and charming others for information or help.

Her **HP** will be **4**, derived from the Thief's base hit die (1d4) plus her Constitution modifier. 

For **Armor Class (AC)**, Lirael will wear **Leather armor**, giving her an AC of **12**.

In terms of equipment, Lirael will have:
- A set of **Thieves’ Tools** for lockpicking and trap removal
- A **dagger** for close encounters 
- A **short bow** for ranged attacks
- A small stash of **coins** (her collection, representing her obsession) 
- A **cloak** with a hood to help with stealth

For background, Lirael is a former noble's daughter who fell from grace after her family's fall from fortune during the Shattering, now seeking both wealth and a path to redeem her family's name.

If everything looks good, I'm ready to lock in Lirael Brightsky!

Awesome, Player 1! Lirael Brightsky's details are all locked in. Here’s a summary of what we have for her:

- **Character Class:** Thief
- **Strength:** 10
- **Intelligence:** 12
- **Wisdom:** 10
- **Dexterity:** 16
- **Constitution:** 10
- **Charisma:** 14
- **HP:** 4 (from 1d4 plus Constitution modifier)
- **AC:** 12 (with leather armor)
- **Equipment:**
  - Thieves’ Tools
  - Dagger
  - Short bow
  - Small stash of coins (her collection)
  - Cloak with a hood for stealth

Lirael's background as a former noble's daughter seeking redemption adds an exciting layer to her character, and I look forward to the interactions that will arise from her quest alongside Fennick and Kaelan.

With all characters finalized, let's transition to the next phase and summarize the scenario and relationships in a cohesive document. 

**PITCH COMPLETE** 

Now, let’s move on to creating those connections and planning how they'll come together during the campaign. I’ll incorporate your backgrounds into the scenarios while also addressing the potential conflicts and engage each character’s motivations. 

Are there specific elements or themes you’d like to explore further in your adventure? Feel free to share your thoughts before I craft the final document!
----------------------------------------

[DM]
Thank you for your patience and insights, everyone! Let’s go ahead and establish those connections and relationships among the characters, and then I’ll craft the scenario for your campaign.

Here’s a possible framework for how your characters might relate to one another:

**Connections:**

1. **Lirael Brightsky and Fennick Torun:**
   - Fennick serves as a mentor figure to Lirael, trying to guide her toward recognizing the importance of balance and caution in her treasure hunting. Their personalities might lead to playful debates about the merits of wealth versus integrity.
   - Lirael’s impulsiveness can frustrate Fennick, especially when her decisions seem reckless, potentially leading to key moments where Fennick must intervene to protect her while she seeks fortune.

2. **Lirael Brightsky and Kaelan Wynter:**
   - Lirael and Kaelan share a sense of adventure, both motivated to seek the artifacts, but for vastly different reasons. Lirael seeks financial gain and family redemption, while Kaelan’s desire is rooted deeply in knowledge and mastery over magic.
   - Their differing approaches might lead to humorous and chaotic situations where Lirael encourages Kaelan's recklessness, prompting Fennick’s growing concern as he attempts to rein them in.

3. **Fennick Torun and Kaelan Wynter:**
   - Fennick’s focus on healing and restoration could cause tension with Kaelan, who may want to act quickly and recklessly in pursuit of knowledge. This dynamic can lead to significant conversations about the responsibilities of power, with Fennick urging caution while Kaelan seeks to push boundaries.
   - Fennick might often find himself torn between supporting Kaelan's thirst for knowledge and ensuring the party's safety—a theme that can ultimately broaden both characters' perspectives.

4. **Group Dynamics:** 
   - The group is a blend of motivations and personalities; this variety within the party can lead to rich roleplaying moments and opportunities for personal growth. They might face conflicts that need negotiation, and as they develop relationships, each character can help shape the others.

Now that we’ve solidified these connections, I’ll create the official campaign scenario and party document. Here’s what you can expect:

[SCENARIO]
The party finds themselves in the town of Eldra's Hollow, a settlement struggling in the aftermath of the Shattering. Reports of strange magical disturbances coincide with rumors of ancient artifacts hidden within the nearby ruins of a temple lost to time. 

Lirael seeks to capitalize on the chaos, hoping to recover treasures that can restore her family's name. Kaelan sees the potential for ancient knowledge that will allow him to wrest control over the chaotic magic of the realm. Meanwhile, Fennick aims to uncover the source of these disturbances to heal the rifts formed by the Shattering.

As they explore the temple, they will encounter both physical challenges, such as traps and guardians left behind, and moral challenges involving the power imbued in the artifacts. Ultimately, the party must decide not just what they want for themselves, but what kind of legacy they wish to leave behind.

Their individual journeys will test their resolve in the chaotic world they inhabit, forming bonds and discovering the true meaning of balance.

[/SCENARIO]

[PARTY_DOCUMENT]
**Characters:**
- **Lirael Brightsky:** A Thief with a charming and impulsive personality seeking redemption for her fallen family.
- **Fennick Torun:** A Cleric dedicated to healing and restoring balance, often acting as the voice of caution among the group.
- **Kaelan Wynter:** A Magic-User driven by reckless curiosity and the desire for knowledge, often pushing boundaries that Fennick wishes to avoid.

**Relationships:**
- **Lirael and Fennick:** Mentor-student dynamic where Fennick attempts to guide Lirael's impulsive nature toward balance.
- **Lirael and Kaelan:** Adventurous spirits whose motivations diverge, causing chaos and humorous situations that challenge their perspectives.
- **Fennick and Kaelan:** Tension between cautiousness and recklessness regarding magical pursuits, leading to deeper discussions about power responsibly.

**Shared History:** 
- They come together due to the common goal of uncovering the artifacts amidst the Shattering's aftermath, with their interactions deepening as they each make sacrifices and face temptations along the way.

**Potential Tensions:**
- Clashing motivations may lead to conflicts, investigations into artifact temptation, and moral decisions on whether to pursue power at the risk of potential consequences.

**SESSION ZERO LOCKED** 

Your characters and the foundation of the campaign are established! I'm excited to see how everything unfolds in your adventure through "The Shattered Realm." If you have any last thoughts or questions before we begin, feel free to share!
